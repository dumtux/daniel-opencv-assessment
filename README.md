# Image Extraction for the Given Color

Using the test photo here, write a Python 3 script that uses OpenCV to automatically draw a boundary box around the green screen. The script produces a new image that contains only the green screen.


## Quickstart

```
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python spike.py
```
